## üß† Project Overview

This project develops a compact, wearable sensor system capable of **real-time motion intent detection** for integration with a **knee exoskeleton**. The system uses **multimodal sensing**‚Äîinertial measurement units (IMUs), surface electromyography (sEMG), and flexible resistive strain sensors (FRS)‚Äîto classify **gait phases** and transition movements (e.g., walking, sit-to-stand, stair ascent/descent).  

Developed as part of the **MSc ENG5059 (2024‚Äì2025)** at the **University of Glasgow**, supervised by **Dr. Lucas Ferrari Gerez**.

## üîÑ Original Plan vs Final Implementation

The design evolved significantly during prototyping.  

### üîπ Original Circuit Plan
<img width="665" height="364" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d084921b-578a-46bf-83e1-9fc8fd085e78" />

- Used a **single IMU (ICM-20948)** connected via I¬≤C with pull-up resistors.  
- EMG sensing relied on a **Grove EMG detector**.  
- Knee flexion measured with a **resistive flex sensor** in a simple voltage divider.  
- Simpler design, but **limited sensing coverage** and higher susceptibility to EMG noise.

### üîπ Final Implemented Circuit

- **2√ó IMUs (thigh + shank)** for relative orientation  
- **MyoWare 2.0 EMG** (medial gastrocnemius)  
- Flex sensor repositioned for consistent knee tracking  
- Teensy used for **synchronized data logging**, classification offloaded to PC  
- Improved **grounding and wiring stability**

## üé• Testing & Results
 
- Initial set of Classifications:Standing, Heel standing, Toe standing, Walking, Sit-to-stand
  - https://github.com/grp2002/MSc-Project---Wearable-Sensors-for-Task-Classification/blob/main/videos/First_Classifications_Test.mp4
  - Heel standing and toe standing were included to evaluate EMG sensitivity over the medial gastrocnemius.

- Revised Classification Set: Standing, Walking, Sitting, Sit-to-stand
  - https://github.com/grp2002/MSc-Project---Wearable-Sensors-for-Task-Classification/blob/main/videos/Second_Classifications_Test.mp4
  - Heel standing and toe standing were removed after results showed minimal contribution to knee kinematic variation.
 
-Final Classification Set: Standing, Walking, Upstairs, Downstairs, Sitting, Sit-to-stand
  - Stair-related activities were added to capture additional lower-limb motion patterns.
- Final classifier achieved:  
  - **98% accuracy (cross-validation)**  
  - Stable real-time prediction with minimal latency
