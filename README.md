## ðŸ§  Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop a compact, wearable sensor system capable of real-time motion intent detection for integration with a knee exoskeleton. The system leverages multimodal sensingâ€”using IMUs, surface EMG, and flexible strain sensorsâ€”to classify gait phases and transition movements such as walking, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit, enabling predictive control for assistive robotics.

Developed as part of the MSc ENG5059 at the University of Glasgow (2024â€“2025), under the supervision of Dr. Lucas Ferrari Gerez.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Sensor Integration**: Develop a wearable suite combining:
  - Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs) for joint kinematics
  - Surface electromyography (sEMG) for muscle activation
  - Flexible resistive strain sensors for knee flexion tracking

- **Real-Time Processing**:
  - Implement filtering and feature extraction pipelines
  - Enable synchronized data acquisition via Teensy 4.1 microcontroller

- **Motion Classification**:
  - Train supervised learning models to identify gait phases and transitions
  - Evaluate classification performance, latency, and fusion accuracy

- **System Evaluation**:
  - Conduct controlled trials
  - Assess wearability, responsiveness, and classification efficacy
