## üß† Project Overview
This project aims to design and develop a compact, wearable sensor system capable of real-time motion intent detection for integration with a knee exoskeleton. The system leverages multimodal sensing‚Äîusing IMUs, surface EMG, and flexible strain sensors‚Äîto classify gait phases and transition movements such as walking, sit-to-stand, and stand-to-sit, enabling predictive control for assistive robotics.

Developed as part of the MSc ENG5059 at the University of Glasgow (2024‚Äì2025), under the supervision of Dr. Lucas Ferrari Gerez.

- Used a **single IMU (ICM-20948)** connected via I¬≤C with pull-up resistors.  
- EMG sensing relied on a **Grove EMG detector**.  
- Knee flexion measured with a **resistive flex sensor** in a simple voltage divider.  
- Simpler design, but **limited sensing coverage** and higher susceptibility to EMG noise.

- Added **two IMUs (thigh + shank)** for improved relative orientation tracking.  
- Switched to **MyoWare 2.0 EMG** (calf placement) for more stable neuromuscular signals.  
- Flex sensor repositioned and calibrated for knee bending measurement.  
- Improved **power routing and grounding** (including a decoupling capacitor and grounding patch).  
- Teensy 4.1 pin mapping fully clarified (A8 ‚Üí EMG, A14 ‚Üí FRS, I¬≤C buses ‚Üí IMUs).

## üîÑ Original Plan vs Final Implementation

This section highlights the original design intentions versus how the project evolved during development and testing.

### ‚úÖ Original Plan

- **Sensor Configuration**:
  - Use **two EMG channels** (rectus femoris and medial gastrocnemius)
  - Track **heel standing and toe standing** as additional activities

- **System Architecture**:
  - Fully embedded **on-device classification** using the Teensy 4.1
  - Include real-time feedback for closed-loop control simulation

- **Data Strategy**:
  - Focus on offline analysis with pre-recorded trials only
  - Train multiple classifiers (e.g., k-NN, SVM, Random Forest)

---

### üõ† Final Implementation

- **Simplified EMG Setup**:
  - EMG on rectus femoris was removed due to high noise and redundancy
  - Final system used **a single EMG channel** (medial gastrocnemius) for intent detection

- **Refined Activity Set**:
  - **Removed toe/heel standing** due to minimal kinematic differentiation
  - Final activity set:
    - Standing, Walking, Sitting, Sit-to-Stand, Upstairs, Downstairs

- **System Processing Flow**:
  - Offloaded real-time classification to a **host PC via serial** (Python-based pipeline)
  - Teensy focused on synchronized data acquisition and logging

- **Model Optimization**:
  - Settled on a **Random Forest Classifier** due to its low latency and high robustness
  - Achieved **98% classification accuracy** across all test conditions

- **User-Centric Adjustments**:
  - Modified knee brace with **Velcro and internal routing** for comfort and consistent sensor positioning
  - Added **grounding patch for EMG** signal stability during dynamic movement
